# Python CSV Comparison Script

This script allows you to compare two CSV files and remove duplicate rows based on specified columns. The script will then export the resulting list as a new CSV file.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Prepare two CSV files you want to compare. The first file will be the original, and the second file will contain the duplicate rows you want to remove.
3. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python script.py <original_csv_file> <duplicate_csv_file>
```

Replace `<original_csv_file>` and `<duplicate_csv_file>` with the respective filenames.

4. The script will output the comparison results and create a new CSV file called `NewList.csv` containing the original data without the duplicate rows.
